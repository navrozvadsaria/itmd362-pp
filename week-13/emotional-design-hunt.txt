# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:As my picture shows what my object is. This is an integral part of my  daily work life. Without my phone I feel like my work is incomplete as it connects me to other peer who works on different floors.

* Behavioral:The structure of phone is same like all other phone with  some extra button on it to provide more facilities to user. It is really easy to use and I can also connect my earphone to my phone.

* Reflective: It reflects how important I am to other people when I hear my voice mails and also talk to people whom I provide support related to work issues.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. focusing on the important content which is really useful for users.

2. Removing unwanted windows and tabs.

3. Providing simplistic and user friendly layout.
