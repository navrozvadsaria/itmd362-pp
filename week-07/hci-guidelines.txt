# Production Problem 5: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment.

You only need to sketch your redesign, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/
* Android Design Guidelines:
  http://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://dev.windows.com/en-us/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/LayoutandAppearance.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH54-SW1
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
Link describes about the layout and adaptivity of page. In my sketch of my.iit page the primary content is login section which should be the center according to the guideline. Also I placed other details like contact us, iit alerts which are less important at the bottom of page.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/ColorImagesText.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH58-SW1
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
Link describes about the color and typography.I mentioned in my sketch that top portion of my.iit page so according to me it should be made a backgroud image which is lighter. Also login section should contains light grey color which is contrast to red color and lower bottom should contains white background color according to guidelines.
 
* HCI Guidline Three (URL):
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Animation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH57-SW1
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
This link is about animation which should be similar to iit.edu page. According to guidelines, i placed the animations which contains images of IIT, students and events which is more interactive than wordings.
